# Front End Application: Body Mass Index Calculator

# Executive Summary
This project was developed and documented by Max Aubain as an exercise to practice React architectures and data flows.  An exceptional resource used for this application is the reactjs.org [Thinking in React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

## Goal and Specifications
A BMI calculator requires body height and weight as inputs, given in metric or imperial units.  A calculuation is involved using the inputs to produce an Index output.  The output is both a numerical value and a qualitative description.
